\title{Calculate Indirectly standardised ratios using calculate_ISRatio}
\usage{
calculate_ISRatio(
  data,
  x,
  n,
  x_ref,
  n_ref,
  refpoptype = "vector",
  type = "full",
  confidence = 0.95,
  refvalue = 1,
  observed_totals = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing the data to be standardised, pre-grouped if
multiple ISRs required; unquoted string; no default}

\item{x}{field name from data containing the observed number of events for
each standardisation category (eg ageband) within each grouping set (eg
area). Alternatively, if not providing age breakdowns for observed events,
field name from observed_totals containing the observed number of events
within each grouping set ; unquoted string; no default}

\item{n}{field name from data containing the populations for each
standardisation category (eg ageband) within each grouping set (eg area);
unquoted string; no default}

\item{x_ref}{the observed number of events in the reference population for
each standardisation category (eg age band); unquoted numeric vector or
field name from data depending on value of refpoptype; no default}

\item{n_ref}{the reference population for each standardisation category (eg
age band); unquoted numeric vector or field name from data depending on
value of refpoptype; no default}

\item{refpoptype}{whether x_ref and n_ref have been specified as vectors or a
field name from data; quoted string "field" or "vector"; default = "vector"}

\item{type}{defines the data and metadata columns to be included in output;
can be "value", "lower", "upper", "standard" (for all data) or "full" (for
all data and metadata); quoted string; default = "full"}

\item{confidence}{the required level of confidence expressed as a number
between 0.9 and 1 or a number between 90 and 100 or can be a vector of 0.95
and 0.998, for example, to output both 95 percent and 99.8 percent percent
CIs; numeric; default 0.95}

\item{refvalue}{the standardised reference ratio, numeric, default = 1}

\item{observed_totals}{data.frame containing total observed events for each
group, if not provided with age-breakdowns in data. Must only contain the
count field (x) plus grouping columns required to join to data using the
same grouping column names; default = NULL}
}
\value{
When type = "full", returns a tibble of observed events, expected
events, standardised mortality ratios, lower confidence limits, upper
confidence limits, confidence level, statistic and method for each grouping
set
}
\description{
Calculates standard mortality ratios (or indirectly standardised ratios) with
confidence limits using Byar's (1) or exact (2) CI method.
}
\section{Notes}{
 User MUST ensure that x, n, x_ref and n_ref vectors are all
ordered by the same standardisation category values as records will be
matched by position. \cr \cr For numerators >= 10 Byar's method (1) is
applied using the internal byars_lower and byars_upper functions.  For
small numerators Byar's method is less accurate and so an exact method (2)
based on the Poisson distribution is used. \cr  \cr This function directly
replaced phe_smr which was fully deprecated in package version 2.0.0 due to
ambiguous naming
