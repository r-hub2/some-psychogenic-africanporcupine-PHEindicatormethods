\title{Calculate Directly Standardised Rates using calculate_dsr}
\usage{
calculate_dsr(
  data,
  x,
  n,
  stdpop = NULL,
  type = "full",
  confidence = 0.95,
  multiplier = 1e+05,
  independent_events = TRUE,
  eventfreq = NULL,
  ageband = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing the data to be standardised, pre-grouped if
multiple DSRs required; unquoted string; no default}

\item{x}{field name from data containing the observed number of events for
each standardisation category (eg ageband) within each grouping set (eg
area); unquoted string; no default}

\item{n}{field name from data containing the populations for each
standardisation category (eg ageband) within each grouping set (eg area);
unquoted string; no default}

\item{stdpop}{field name from data containing the standard populations for
each age band; unquoted string; no default}

\item{type}{defines the data and metadata columns to be included in output;
can be "value", "lower", "upper", "standard" (for all data) or "full" (for
all data and metadata); quoted string; default = "full"}

\item{confidence}{the required level of confidence expressed as a number
between 0.9 and 1 or a number between 90 and 100 or can be a vector of 0.95
and 0.998, for example, to output both 95 percent and 99.8 percent percent
CIs; numeric; default 0.95}

\item{multiplier}{the multiplier used to express the final values (eg 100,000
= rate per 100,000); numeric; default 100,000}

\item{independent_events}{whether events are independent. Set to TRUE for
independent events. When set to FALSE an adjustment is made to the
confidence intervals - to do this, the dataset provided must include event
frequency breakdowns and column x is redefined as the number of unique
individuals who experienced each frequency of event, rather than the total
number of events. The function will then calculate the variance to pass
into the final DSR calculation by first calculating the variance for the
separate person-frequency data.}

\item{eventfreq}{field name from data containing the event frequencies. Only
required when independent_events = FALSE; unquoted string; default NULL}

\item{ageband}{field name from data containing the age bands for
standardisation. Only required when independent_events = FALSE; unquoted
string; default NULL}
}
\value{
When type = "full", returns a tibble of total counts, total
populations, directly standardised rates, lower confidence limits, upper
confidence limits, confidence level, statistic and method for each grouping
set. Use the type argument to limit the columns output.
}
\description{
Calculates directly standardised rates with confidence limits using Byar's
method (1) with Dobson method adjustment (2) including option to further
adjust confidence limits for non-independent events (3).
}
\section{Notes}{
 For total counts >= 10 Byar's method (1) is applied using
the internal byars_lower and byars_upper functions. When the total count is
< 10 DSRs are not reliable and will therefore be suppressed in the output.

# and 70\% occurred in people who experienced a single event.
