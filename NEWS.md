## PHEindicatormethods v2.1.0
* `calculate_dsr` function added to replace `phe_dsr`. The new calculate_dsr function has three new features:
1. Users can now specify whether events are independent.  For non-independent events the function performs an adjustment to the confidence interval calculation. 
2. The stdpoptype argument that was available in `phe_dsr` is not available in `calculate_dsr` and the user is now required to provide the standard populations as a field in the input dataframe. This is to negate the risk of incorrectly joining the standard population vector by position that was possible when using the function with stdpoptype = "vector".
3. Because of point 2 above, users can now calculate DSRs for groups containing different numbers of age bands in a single execution (for example DSRs for all age populations and DSRs for under 75s).   
* `phe_dsr` has been soft deprecated - please replace all calls to this function with `calculate_dsr` before September 2025, after which date the phe_dsr function will be removed from the package. Previous calls to `phe_dsr` with stdpoptype set to "field" can be replaced directly with `calculate_dsr`, however, the stdpop argument no longer has a default so will need to be provided explicitly. For previous calls to `phe_dsr` with stdpoptype = "vector", the user will need to append the standard populations to their input data frame before calling the `calculate_dsr` function and provide the stdpop argument explicitly.

## PHEindicatormethods v2.0.2
* Amended phe_quantile function so it will not produce quantiles when the number of small areas within a group is less than the number of quantiles requested. A warning will be generated when quantiles cannot be produced for this reason.
* removed the highergeog argument from phe_quantile function, previously soft-deprecated in v1.2.0.
* `phe_sii` amended to allow data to be transformed prior to calculation of the SII, and to allow the intercept value to be output.

## PHEindicatormethods v2.0.1
* `calculate_ISRate` and `calculate_ISRatio` updated so observed events can be passed as total without age breakdowns
* amended GitHub referencing as code repository now owned and hosted by UKHSA-collaboration not PublicHealthEngland

## PHEindicatormethods v2.0.0
* `phe_smr` and `phe_isr` functions which were previously soft-deprecated have now been removed - see NEWS from release version 1.4.0 for replacements for these functions.
* `phe_proportion` amended so option to request no confidence intervals is allowed.

## PHEindicatormethods v1.4.2
* updated for compatibility with tidyselect v1.2.0 and purrr releases due December 2022

## PHEindicatormethods v1.4.0

* `calculate_funnel_limits()`, `assign_funnel_significance()` and `prepare_funnel_plot()` functions added. This provides ability to calculate funnel plot lines and significance for provided data in line with [Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/guidance/supporting-information/PH-methods) published technical guidance.
* `calculate_ISRate` and `calculate_ISRatio` functions replace `phe_isr` and `phe_smr` respectively. `phe_isr` and `phe_smr` functions remain available in this release but are lifecycle badged as deprecated and function documentation signposts users to the new replacement functions.  This is purely a renaming exercise to overcome ambiguous acronyms used in the original function names and there is no change to the functionality of the code. `phe_isr` and `phe_smr` are scheduled to be removed in a future release of the package, not before December 2022.
* `phe_life_expectancy` now forces suppression of LEs when the 95% confidence interval is greater than 20 years.


## PHEindicatormethods v1.3.2

`phe_dsr`, `phe_isr`, `phe_mean`, `phe_proportion`, `phe_rate`, `phe_smr`, `phe_life_expectancy` amended so output data frame has the same grouping attributes as the input data frame.

## PHEindicatormethods v1.3.1

`phe_proportion`, `phe_rate`, `phe_quantile`, `phe_life_expectancy`, `phe_sii`:  
Functions amended to ensure continued compatibility with dplyr when v1.0.0 is released.
These changes will not be noticeable to end users.

`phe_life_expectancy`: dropped population and death columns from output as these are no longer applicable to the final LE statistic.  Added pops_used and dths_used columns to output when type = 'full' which reflect the cumulative populations and deaths used in each LE calculation (ie the pops and deaths for all ages equal to or above the Life_Expectancy_At age)


## PHEindicatormethods v1.3.0
* `phe_sii function` updated to be able to output multiple confidence intervals
* `phe_life_expectancy()` function previously calculated life expectancy and confidence levels inaccurately when the number of deaths in all age groups except the final one was 40% or more of the size of the population in any age group (apart from the 1–4 age group where it’s 50%). It had an affect in very few scenarios, but was inaccurate nonetheless. This has now been corrected to agree with the published methodology
* `phe_life_expectancy()` now accepts a numeric vector as an input to the `confidence` argument so users can calculate multiple confidence limits in one command
* `phe_dsr` The standardised_pop output variable added in v1.2.0 has been removed as this was not providing a meaningful value. This may result in some backwards incompatibility if code has been written to reference (eg drop) this column as it will no longer be included in the phe_dsr output.


## PHEindicatormethods v1.2.0
The following changes may affect backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the package:  

* phe_quantile - highergeog argument deprecated.  Argument wasn't providing any additional functionality and its use was affecting grouping sets on output data frame.  Input dataframe must now be pre-grouped to reproduce the results previously obtained using the highergeog argument.  Also documentation references to geographies removed as function is applicable to other subgroups.

<br>

The following changes will not affect backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the package: 

* Amended functions to use new embrace interpolation features of rlang 0.4.0: dsr, isr, smr, rate, proportion, mean, quantile.  Package dependencies now require Rlang version 0.4.0 or higher   

* Added ability to output both 95% and 99.8% confidence intervals in a single execution to dsr, isr, smr, rate, proportion, mean functions

* Amended phe_dsr to also output the standardised population used in the calculation when type="full"

* Some warnings that occurred with `phe_life_expectancy()` have been fixed

## PHEindicatormethods v1.1.5
phe_sii function updated to be compatible with nest and unnest functions from tidyr version 1.0

## PHEindicatormethods v1.1.4
No significant changes.
Removed confusing line of commented out code from phe_life_expectancy calculation
Amended vignette title

## PHEindicatormethods v1.1.3

Minor amendments to package testing scripts to work on platforms using clang as compiler.  
Updates will not affect end users using other platforms.  

## PHEindicatormethods v1.1.2

Minor amendments to package testing scripts to work on platforms using clang as compiler.
Updates will not affect end users using other platforms.  


## PHEindicatormethods v1.1.1

The following changes may affect backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the package:  

* phe_proportion: Replaced logical PERCENTAGE argument with a numeric MULTIPLIER argument to enable proportions to be expressed more flexibly (eg per 1000). Default is now multiplier = 1 which gives equivalent output to the previous default of percentage = FALSE.  There is loss of backwards compatibility where the percentage argument has previously been specified in the function call - please replace 'percentage=TRUE' with 'multiplier=100' and 'percentage=FALSE' with 'multiplier=1'.

* all functions using the TYPE argument: Altered the default value for the TYPE argument from 'standard' to 'full'.  This may affect backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the package - where type has not been specified output will now contain additional metadata columns - to remove these please specify type = "standard" as a function argument.

* `byars_lower()`, `byars_upper()`, `wilson_lower()` and `wilson_upper()` functions have been moved to the package utilities and are less readily available to be used as stand-alone functions within the package.  These functions are intended to be called using other 'phe-' prefixed package functions.  

<br>

The following changes will not affect backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the package:  

* `phe_life_expectancy()` function added for calculation of life expectancy at different ages based on population and death data

* `phe_quantile()` function added for assigning data to quantiles

* `phe_sii()` function added for calculation of slope index of inequality and relative index of inequality

* `phe_proportion()` and `phe_rate()` functions now return aggregate data when grouped data is passed

* Altered handling of NA values in `phe_proportion()`, `phe_rate()` and `phe_mean()` functions to enable results to be returned for the records which do not contain invalid NAs 

* Altered handling of NA values in `phe_dsr()` function such that NA values in the age-specific count data are assumed to be equal to zero and no longer cause the function to error

* Altered handling of NA values in `phe_isr()` and `phe_smr()` functions such that NA values in the age-specific count, age-specific population and/or reference count data are assumed to be equal to zero and no longer cause the functions to error
